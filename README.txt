An auto stop-cast tool for World of Warcraft 1.12.1.5875 (for Windows)

To cast a spell at your current target using this tool, create a macro of the format
"/script CastSpellAtTarget(x)" where x is the numerical id of the spell you wish to cast.

To cast a spell at your current mouseover target using this tool, create a macro of the
format "/script CastSpellAtMouseover(x)" where x is the numerical id of the spell you
wish to cast.

To launch, run loader.exe -p c:\path\to\wow.exe (or just loader.exe with it inside the
main wow folder)

Note that while this makes no malicious changes to the WoW client, it could easily be
mistaken as malicious by the primitive anticheats in use on most vanilla private
servers.  This program contains absolutely no protection against anticheat software.

Feenix / wow-one.com has said that they will not ban people for using it.  Refer to
this thread: http://www.wow-one.com/forum/topic/88974-will-running-this-mod-get-people-banned/

Kronos / Twinstar has said that while they do not support client modification, they
will not specifically target this mod.  Refer to this thread:

Nostalrius declined to answer my inquiry.  While they are not currently doing anything
that would cause this to be detected, the modifications are detectable if they decide
to take the time to do it.  For reference, this is the thread where I posed the question:
